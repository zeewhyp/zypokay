I am currently a Year 2 Communications and New Media student in NUS, also minoring in Sociology.\nI have created this website using Quarto as part of the final project for the NM2207 Module.\nThe topic that I chose was Social Media in Singapore. I felt it was a relevant topic to discuss, and it was also not too difficult to find different data sets to work with."
